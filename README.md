# memester

memester is a meme search and share app for android, this has better functionality then the meme-apk
with lazyLoad images with masonary layout and has related tags images too and pressing the tag will load more images of that tag name and save images to favorites.

## making this project

Originaly i wanted to make this app download the images to the mobile but i just cant find good way of doing this at the moment,
i finally got download working by drawing the images to a canvas then downloading the canvas but this only works in browser and not apk
so i tried adding file transfer plugin for cordova but still not working so adding a download feature will have to wait.
Instead i decided to make it into a meme sharing app with the cordova social sharing plugin, i learnt how to impliment lazyload and masonary layout into apps
also learnt more about using api data."
